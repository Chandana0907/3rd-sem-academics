1. Setting up and Basic Commands
Initialize a new Git Repository in a directory. Create a new file and add it to the staging area and commit
the changes with an appropriate commit message.
Step 1: Initialize a new Git Repository
● Open a terminal or command prompt.
● Create a Directory
mkdir first
● Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Git repository.
cd path/to/your/directory
● Initialize a new Git repository.
git init
Step 2: Create a New File
● Use any text editor of your choice to create a new file in the repository directory. For
example, let's create a file named sample.txt.
vim sample.txt
● Open sample.txt in your text editor and add some content.
Step 3: Add the File to the Staging Area
● Add the newly created file to the staging area.
git add sample.txt
This command stages the changes in sample.txt for the next commit.
Step 4: Commit the Changes

git commit -m "Initial commit: Added sample.txt
