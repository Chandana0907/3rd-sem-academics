Collaboration and Remote Repositories
Clone a remote Git repository to your local machine
Step 1: Create the remote repository in Github
Step 2: Clone the repository
To clone a remote Git repository to your local machine, you can use the git clone command.
Here's the basic syntax:
git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the Git repository you want to clone. For example:
git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git
This command will create a copy of the entire remote repository, including all branches and
commit history, in a new directory on your local machine. The directory will have the same name
as the repository.
Optional -
If you want to clone the repository into a specific directory, you can specify the destination
directory after the repository URL:
git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git <destination_directory>
