Collaboration and Remote Repositories
Fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and rebase your local branch onto the updated
remote branch.
To fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and rebase your local branch onto the
updated remote branch, you can follow these steps:
Step 1: Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
git fetch
This command fetches the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into
your local branches.
Step 2: Rebase your local branch onto the updated remote branch:
git rebase origin/<branch_name>
Replace <branch_name> with the name of the branch you want to rebase. This command
applies your local changes on top of the fetched changes from the remote branch.
Step 3: Rebase the changes
git add . # Stage the resolved changes
git rebase --continue # Continue with the rebase
Step 4: Push the rebased changes to the remote repository:
git push origin <branch_name> --force
Be cautious when using --force with git push as it overwrites the remote branch with your local
changes.
